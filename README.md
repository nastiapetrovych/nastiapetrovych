## About me
Hi! I am Anastasiia, a recent graduate (2025) of IT & Business Analytics program at [Ukrainian Catholic University](https://ucu.edu.ua/en/) :books:

Currently, I work as a Research Engineer at CERN, contributing in particular to the [Next Generation Trigger project](https://nextgentriggers.web.cern.ch/) . My work focuses on hardware-aware machine learning ⚛️, with an emphasis on model compression techniques such pruning, quantization, and hyperparameter optimization for models deployed under strict latency, memory, and precision constraints (FPGAs, GPUs, real-time pipelines). I’m one of the core contributors to [PQuantML](https://github.com/nroope/PQuant), an open framework for reproducible compression-aware training and optimization. 

Additionally, I am a Research Assistant at the [Computational Neuroscience Lab at University of Toronto](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Computational-Neuroscience-Lab-Brokoslaw-Laschowski) 🧠 under the supervision of [Dr. Brokoslaw Laschowski](https://neuroscience.utoronto.ca/brokoslaw-laschowski), where I work on Representational alignment of predictive coding networks using topological regularization. 


My main interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, biomedical research and real-world deployment.
